# Wind-Weather-App:

The goal of this project is to create an application which allows the user to search for a specific location to get information about the weather. Actually we only need data about the wind strength of that location,
because that's what kitesurfers need to choose their next spot to surf. In a later stage the application could be expanded with flight informations so that the user would be able to search for flight connections and prices for 
locations with good wind conditions.
